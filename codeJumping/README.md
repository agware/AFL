As the AFL Women's league has gotten up and running, there's been a lot of talk about players transitioning from other sports to play AFL. I wanted to practice making force directed graphs whilst also investigating just how prevalent code jumping is.

Overall I think the main thing I learnt is that a disproportionately large number of women have some sort of background in javelin. If anyone has any theories about why that is, I'm really curious.

For a player to be linked with AFL they had to have played more than 5 matches, at least one of which had to be before 2016. They also had to have played at least one game in the previous 3 years.

Any mistakes in the data are almost certainly my own, please feel free to contact me if you notice anything.
