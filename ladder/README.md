Possibly one of the most exciting parts of football is the constant underlying tension of who's going to make it to the Grand Final. This year's women's competition has a particularly novel approach to this with no qualifying finals. Instead, whoever is on top of the ladder at the end of the season will face off.

The goal of this animation is to answer the ever important question, <b>can my team still make the Grand Final?</b>
